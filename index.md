insta-RT is a set of software tools to make the process of contour evaluations by radiation oncologists faster by incorporating dosimetric information into the pipeline.

The [current radiation treatment planning workflow](./current-workflow.html) in clinics is long and tedious. This involves many different providers: radiation oncologists, dosimetrists, medical technicians and others. Depending on scheduling and coordination between them, the wait times for patients can be as high as two weeks. 

insta-RT attempts to [change this status-quo](./features.html) by introducing automation and knowledge based intelligence into this workflow. We believe this technology has the potential to bring a new paradigm in how radiation oncology is done.

## Useful links

We have put together a [getting-started guide](./tutorials.html) for learning more about how insta-RT can be used.

More [documentation](./documentation.html) is a work in progress, and a typical set of use-cases is described [here](./use-cases.html).

Initial [clinical evidence](./publications.html) has been published already, and more is in the works.
