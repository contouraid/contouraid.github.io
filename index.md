ContourAId is a co-pilot for making the radiotherapy treatment planning process faster and more accurate.

The [current radiation treatment planning workflow](./current-workflow.html) in clinics is long and tedious. This involves many different providers: radiation oncologists, dosimetrists, medical technicians and others. Depending on scheduling and coordination between them, the wait times for patients can be as high as two weeks. 

ContourAId attempts to [change this status-quo](./features.html) by introducing automation and knowledge based intelligence into this workflow. We believe this technology has the potential to bring a new paradigm in how radiation oncology is done.
