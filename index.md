ContourAID aims to revolutionize radiation oncology by reducing radiotherapy planning time from weeks to days. By streamlining contouring and minimizing feedback loops between doctors and physicists, our solution ensures a high-quality, and efficient planning workflow. This accelerates treatment initiation and improves treatment outcomes, while alleviating the burden on clinicians. Our mission is to enhance global care through innovative, reliable software.

### The Problem

Accurate contouring of target volumes and organs is vital for optimal radiotherapy treatments. However, the process is complex, relying on clinician expertise, subjective interpretation, and multidisciplinary collaboration. This leads to:

• Inefficient tedious tasks for doctors.
• Inconsistent results that are prone to errors.
• Extended planning times.

A more efficient and accurate approach is required to ensure consistent, high-quality patient care, enhancing treatment efficiency and outcomes.

### The Solution

ContourAID uses AI to generate contours for organs and targets from CT and MR imaging in glioblastoma patients. It combines automatic segmentation and dose prediction, to provide real-time quality control, dosimetric feedback, and pre-planning insights to streamline radiotherapy workflows. By enhancing quality assurance, and reducing feedback loops, ContourAID accelerates planning, improves treatment accuracy and ultimately provides faster and high-quality care for patients.
