## Why insta-RT?

This page describes some of the unique features of the insta-RT idea, and why we think this will change the way radiation oncology is done.

### Feature 1

Highlight the user benefits, not the specific software feature: Dosimetric awareness while contouring, helps clinicians to make contour changes that are truly clinically relevant. The radiation oncologist will be able to visualize in real time, a best approximation of the dose distribution the contours he/she drew can lead to, thereby understanding better how feasible it could be to minimize toxicity to specific organs at risk.

### Feature 2

Heatmaps that can indicate where an automatically generated contour needs to be manually checked for critical situations with treatment planning. These heatmaps can indicate before full manual evaluation which is currently based purely on geometry, if, it is worth spending time to check what may happen if the contour is modified slightly in a local region. 

### Feature 3

Automatic estimation of best possible plan quality given geometric constraints in the contours, and, hardware limitations of the scanner: dosimetrists can speed up their workflow based on the difficulty of the problem, thereby creating an array of alternative plans for clinical evaluation by the radiation oncologist.
